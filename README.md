How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by using JUnit testing to check for both functionailty and what will happen if there is an invalid input. Other things I can do are to use user authentication, limit what the error codes say by having them focus on a specific error, and validate user inputs.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

My goal when interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program is to take the base requirements given to me and write them to be the code's skeleton and test to make sure it runs as intended. After I have the base requirements coded, then I read between the lines and start to group complementary methods together. Then comes the testing to make sure I did not make any new errors when incorporating the methods together.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach, as stated above, is to take the requirements and write the skeleton of the code with the required methods. After testing each one individually, then I start to bring them together and implement them as a whole package, testing along the way to make sure no new errors are made.
